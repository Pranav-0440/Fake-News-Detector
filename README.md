# Fake-News-Detector
Problem Description
Manually identifying fake news is time-consuming and inefficient due to the sheer volume of content generated daily. Traditional fact-checking organizations cannot keep up with the rapid spread of misinformation. An AI-powered fake news detection system can provide a scalable solution by automatically analyzing news content and assessing its credibility.

This project involves developing a web-based application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect whether a given news article is fake or real. Additionally, the system will provide explanations for its predictions, enhancing transparency and user trust.
